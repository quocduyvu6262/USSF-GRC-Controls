# USSF GRC Controls

**USSF GRC Controls** is a SaaS application built with Ruby on Rails to help USSF representatives ensure their Docker images comply with NIST SP800-53 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) controls. The platform scans public and private Docker images for vulnerabilities, maps them to relevant NIST controls, and provides detailed compliance reports. With features like version control, access management, and an intuitive interface, it streamlines the process of maintaining secure, compliant containerized environments.
